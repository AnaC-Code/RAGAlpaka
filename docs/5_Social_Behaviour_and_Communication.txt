Chapter 5: Social Behavior and Communication

Alpacas are social animals that live in herds, exhibiting complex behaviors and communication methods. They use body language, vocalizations, and even physical interactions to convey messages.

A common behavior is the “clucking” sound mothers make to communicate with their young, known as crias. Alpacas also hum to express curiosity, contentment, or stress. When threatened, they may emit a loud, high-pitched warning call.

Understanding alpaca behavior is essential for effective management and bonding with these animals. This chapter explores their social structures, communication methods, and behavioral patterns.
