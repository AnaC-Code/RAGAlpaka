Chapter 4: Habitat and Adaptability

Adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andes, alpacas are remarkably resilient animals. They thrive in altitudes ranging from 3,500 to 5,000 meters, where temperatures fluctuate drastically between day and night. Their thick fleece provides insulation against the cold, while their padded feet minimize environmental impact.

When raised outside their native environment, alpacas adapt well to diverse climates, provided they have adequate shelter and care. They prefer open pastures with access to shaded areas during hot weather. Proper fencing is necessary to protect them from predators.

This chapter examines the natural habitat of alpacas, their adaptability to various climates, and the considerations needed for creating a suitable living environment for domesticated herds.
