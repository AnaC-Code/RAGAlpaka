Chapter 6: Reproduction and Breeding

Alpacas have unique reproductive cycles. Unlike many mammals, females are induced ovulators, meaning ovulation occurs only after mating. The gestation period lasts about 11.5 months, typically resulting in the birth of a single cria.

Selective breeding programs focus on improving fiber quality, conformation, and other desirable traits. This chapter discusses the intricacies of alpaca reproduction, the birthing process, and the principles of responsible breeding.

The birthing process, or unpacking, usually occurs in the morning hours, allowing the cria ample time to dry and adjust to the environment. Alpaca mothers are attentive but allow their young to grow independent quickly. The cria begins nursing shortly after birth and will be weaned around six months. Managing alpaca reproduction requires careful planning to avoid inbreeding and to ensure the health of both mother and offspring.
