Chapter 7: Health and Common Diseases

Maintaining alpaca health involves a combination of preventive care, observation, and prompt treatment. Regular vaccinations protect alpacas against diseases such as clostridial infections, while deworming programs minimize the risk of internal parasites. External parasites, like mites, can cause skin conditions that require specific treatments.

Dental health is a key aspect of alpaca care. Since their teeth grow continuously, overgrown teeth can interfere with eating and lead to malnutrition. Trimming teeth and monitoring jaw alignment are necessary for long-term well-being.

Digestive health is another critical area. Alpacas are prone to conditions such as bloat and ulcers, often linked to diet or stress. Ensuring access to high-quality forage and avoiding sudden dietary changes can prevent many issues. Additionally, alpacas may suffer from heat stress in hot climates, which necessitates proper shading, ventilation, and hydration.

Recognizing early signs of illness, such as lethargy, weight loss, or changes in behavior, allows for timely intervention. Routine health check-ups and a relationship with a knowledgeable veterinarian are invaluable for maintaining a healthy herd.

This expanded chapter provides comprehensive insights into the common health challenges alpacas face, along with practical strategies for prevention and care.
