Chapter 3: Fiber and Its Uses

Alpaca fiber is renowned for its softness, warmth, and durability. Often compared to cashmere and mohair, alpaca fleece is hypoallergenic and comes in a natural range of 22 colors, from white to black and various shades of brown and gray. This diversity makes it a favorite among artisans and textile industries.

The fiber is sheared annually, yielding an average of 5-10 pounds of fleece per alpaca. The fleece is classified into two grades: primary (blanket) and secondary (neck and leg). The blanket fiber is the finest and most valuable, while the secondary fiber is coarser but still useful for products like rugs and insulation.

Alpaca fiber’s unique structure gives it thermal insulation properties, making it suitable for garments like sweaters, scarves, and socks. Unlike wool, it contains no lanolin, which means it doesn’t require harsh chemicals for cleaning. This eco-friendly aspect further enhances its appeal.

This chapter delves into the characteristics of alpaca fiber, its processing methods, and its various applications, showcasing why it is considered a treasure among natural fibers.
