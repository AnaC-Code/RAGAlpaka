Chapter 9: Economic Importance

The alpaca industry has grown globally, with their fiber in high demand for sustainable and luxurious textiles. Alpacas are relatively low-maintenance compared to other livestock, making them an attractive option for small-scale farmers and hobbyists.

The value chain begins with raw fleece production and extends to yarn spinning, textile manufacturing, and artisanal crafts. Small farms often sell fleece directly to co-ops or participate in farm-to-consumer markets. Larger operations may export fleece to international buyers, where it is processed into high-end garments.

Alpaca tourism is another burgeoning industry. Farms offering interactive experiences, such as alpaca walks and workshops, attract visitors and provide supplementary income.

Challenges remain, including market saturation and competition with synthetic fibers. However, the emphasis on sustainable and ethical practices continues to drive interest in alpaca products.

This chapter examines the multifaceted economic contributions of alpacas, from their role in local communities to their impact on global markets.
